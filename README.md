# simpleUnsupervisedLearning
An unsupervised clustering project based on star classification

This dataset was located on Kaggle and was created by the user deepu1109. It provides several measurements of 24 stars and assigns each into 1 or 7 categories.

The project here was to apply some dimensionality reduction techniques in order to visualize the data and then to select the best performing and then to do likewise with a couple of clustering algorightms.

The project is very basic and is a simple exploration of the topics.
